We've always strived to be as open and transparent with our users as possible,
and making reddit open source is part of that. When we say "open-source" we mean
specifically that the code behind reddit is available to the public for
download, and we're inviting the public to submit code to help improve the
site.

reddit is unique in the social news scene in that we have a huge community of
developers. It seems only natural that we give you all in that community a
chance to contribute back to reddit and make it a better place for everyone. We
know reddit's success has less to do with our technology than it does with you,
our community, and we want to let our community improve our technology.
