Here at reddit, we use the entirely made up Code Salon Review Methodâ„¢.  This consists of a few [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) that we use to indicate states of the review process.  Those emoji are, in roughly the order they'd be seen in review:

***

* ![nail care](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/nail_care.png?v5) :nail_care:<br /> `:nail_care:`

  by a reviewer: "I've finished my review pass and am awaiting your responses."

* ![haircut](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/haircut.png?v5) :haircut:<br /> `:haircut:`

  by the author: "I've responded or made appropriate changes and am ready for further review."

* ![fish](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/fish.png?v5) :fish:<br />
`:fish:`

  by a reviewer: "I think this pull request is ready for merging."

* ![running](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/running.png?v5) :running:<br />
`:running:`

  by a reviewer: "I don't have time to review this at the moment, please find someone else."

* ![no bell](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/no_bell.png?v5) :no_bell:<br />
`:no_bell:`

  by a reviewer: "This is just a comment and requires no action."
***

The [bot that runs in the #reddit-dev IRC channel](https://github.com/spladug/harold) will announce to the channel any time these symbols are used during review of a pull request.  This helps remind us that there's stuff to do.  You'll probably see us use these symbols during review of your pull requests. Please feel free to use the appropriate ones in response.

Where did this all come from, you ask? Truth be told, it's pretty much just a random smattering of emoji that we cobbled together over time.
