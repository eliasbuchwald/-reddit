Here at reddit, we use the slightly batty and entirely made up Beauty Salon Code Review Methodâ„¢.  This consists of a few beauty-related [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) that we use to indicate states of the review process.  Those emoji are, in roughly the order they'd be seen in review:

***

* ![nail care](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/nail_care.png?v5) :nail_care:

  by a reviewer: "I've finished my review pass and am awaiting your responses."

* ![haircut](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/haircut.png?v5) :haircut:

  by the author: "I've considered your responses and taken appropriate action."


* ![fish](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/fish.png?v5) :fish:

  by a reviewer: "I think this pull request is ready for merging."

The [bot that runs in the #reddit-dev IRC channel](https://github.com/spladug/harold) will announce to the channel any time these symbols are used during review of a pull request.  This helps remind us that there's stuff to do.  You'll probably see us use these symbols during review of your pull requests. Please feel free to use the appropriate ones in response.
